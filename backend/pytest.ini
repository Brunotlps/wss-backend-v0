# pytest.ini - Configuration file for pytest testing framework
# This file configures how pytest runs tests in your project

# The [tool:pytest] section contains all pytest configuration options
[tool:pytest]

# Common configuration options that would typically go here:

# testpaths = tests/
# Specifies which directories pytest should look for test files

# python_files = test_*.py *_test.py
# Defines naming patterns for test files pytest should discover

# python_classes = Test*
# Defines naming patterns for test classes

# python_functions = test_*
# Defines naming patterns for test functions

# addopts = -v --tb=short
# Additional command line options to always apply when running pytest
# -v = verbose output, --tb=short = shorter traceback format

# markers =
#     slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
#     integration: marks tests as integration tests
# Defines custom test markers for categorizing and filtering tests

# filterwarnings =
#     ignore::UserWarning
#     ignore::DeprecationWarning
# Controls which warnings to show/ignore during test runs

# This file allows you to set project-wide defaults for pytest behavior
# without having to specify command line options every time you run tests
